			{
				"title": "What is The Sandbox?",
				"description": "The Sandbox is user-generated content platform powered by blockchain technology where creators will be able to craft, play, share and trade without central control, enjoying secure copyright ownership with the ability to earn cryptocurrency!"
			},
			{
				"title": "How is The Sandbox different?",
				"description": "Existing voxel games are highly centralized and do not allow voxel artists to receive the full value for their work. The Sandbox is taking a unique decentralized and user-centric approach to offer more to artists."
			},
			{
				"title": "What is the $SAND Token?",
				"description": "Pixowl is introducing “SAND”, a new cryptocurrency based on Ethereum´s ERC-20 token standard. It will give millions of voxel artists and game creators the required tools to generate revenue from their virtual creations on The Sandbox platform and marketplace. SAND tokens will allow creators to buy & trade several types of unique digital assets in the form of non-fungible tokens supported by the ERC-721 standard.  They will be available on The Sandbox platform. SAND will allow users to begin trading user-generated content in the marketplace. At first, these tokens will be acquirable through an Initial Coin Offering in the future."
			},
			{
				"title": "How does The Sandbox platform generate Revenue after the Token Sale?",
				"description": "Revenue in The Sandbox will be generated through three streams:<br/>- ICO: The ICO for the $SAND token will raise funds for development, marketing, and live operations as described in Use of Funds below.<br/>- Content sales: While in-game creators will create a large percentage of items in the game, Pixowl will also create core assets that can be sold to players. These assets will be of high quality and will form the ‘building blocks’ many players will use initially.<br/>- In-game Advertising: Billboards and click-through ads will be available. In addition, opportunities for branded or theme worlds—for instance, a world dedicated to an upcoming film—will be made available to license holders for a negotiated fee."
			},
			{
				"title": "Why don’t you sell BOX tokens in the private / pre-sale, instead of (or in addition of) SAND",
				"description": "SAND is the main token of The Sandbox ecosystem and the only one based on the ERC-20 standard, it is our intention to make it the only fungible token and sole currency of the ecosystem. Without it, users will not be able to publish ASSETs or BOXs in the marketplace. - If we sell BOXs in other currency such as ETH or BTC it would decrease the utility and value of SAND."
			},
			{
				"title": "Is $SAND a utility token?",
				"description": "SAND is a utility token since it gives access to all the different products in the marketplace to potential users of the platform. It also gives players access to any gives BOX's special features or content through microtransactions or subscriptions."
			},
			{
				"title": "Can Players mint the $SAND token?",
				"description": "Initially, during the ICO phase, SAND will be minted by our smart contract directly to the investors. once the ICO phase is over, players will be able to earn SAND as a reward for multiple actions such as winning challenges, selling amazing creations or defeating battle royal games."
			},
			{
				"title": "What are the different Token Sale phases?",
				"description": "We will have an initial $SAND supply of 1,000,000,000 $SAND. Of these, we will sale 50% of the supply (i.e. 500,000,000 tokens) executed in the following phases:<br/>- Private Sales: Initial sales will see the distribution of 59,438,187 tokens.<br/>- Pre-Sale: Second sale of 163,169,303 tokens.<br/>- Public Sales: Third and last sale of tokens. The amount available will be 277,392,510 tokens."
			},
			{
				"title": "How much is $SAND token worth?",
				"description": "Initially, 1 $SAND will be worth US$0.07210    &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp                                                                           <br/>"
			},
			{
				"title": "Why ASSETS are limited?",
				"description": "ASSETs are non-fungible tokens based on the ERC-721 standard, thus, NOT limited. However, we do charge a small fee upon upload to the marketplace to discourage low-quality ASSETS and even copycats. This small fee will be more than covered to creators when they sell their ASSETS for a profit."
			},
			{
				"title": "Why ASSETS would increase in value?",
				"description": "There are several variables that affect ASSET prices. One would be that the creator of the asset becomes famous and thus increasing the demand for his creations. And another reason would be that in a seasonal period of time like Halloween, ASSETS like pumpkins increase their value because there is more demand for them."
			},
			{
				"title": "Why BOXes are limited?",
				"description": "BOXs are non-fungible tokens based on the ERC-721 standard, thus, NOT limited. We will, however, release fixed amounts of BOXs with special properties. We call them Gen[N] BOX. The lower the number on the generation of the BOX, the higher the % of the revenue of in-game sales we will give to creators. Gen[0] BOX gives 100% of the proceeds to the creator while higher gen numbers give exponentially lower. Market price will determine the value of these BOXs and as time passes and more and more creators seek these Gen[0] BOX, the higher their value will be, so it's best to acquire them at the very beginning."
			},
			{
				"title": "Why BOX would increase in value?",
				"description": "Each and every BOX is different in its contents, but what will make them truly unique is the potential content the users can create inside it.<br/><br/>A BOX gains value as creators fill their BOX with different assets and scripts in the future to make varied, interesting gaming experiences available.<br/><br/>If at any point a player wishes to sell their BOX, they will be able to offer the full customized package in the marketplace to any other player willing to buy it."
			},
			{
				"title": "Can ASSETs and BOXes be traded on alternative marketplaces?",
				"description": "Interoperability between Marketplaces.<br/>We will develop our API and give full support to the most important Marketplaces like OPSkins, giving creators and players the possibility to have several ways to market their creations."
			},
			{
				"title": "Why is the blockchain required?",
				"description": "Pixowl’s belief is that a properly integrated blockchain-based system can vastly improve both the creative user experience and economic dynamic of games with User Generated Content (UGC). By itself, such a blockchain system doesn’t make the game look any better, load any faster or magically become more exciting to play. But when implemented into an entertaining game (which provides a fun place to play) with a large community (which provides an audience to sell and trade with) it can coalesce the experience into a more satisfying, coherent whole that can reward both players and developers."
			},
			{
				"title": "Is our Token interoperable with other platforms or games?",
				"description": "We have our sights set in the potential benefits of interoperability, and so we are planning to allow other crypto-games and marketplaces to make use of and benefit from our $SAND token. This will allow the organic creation of an ecosystem where $SAND stands in the center of it as the main payment currency and ASSETS and BOX as the main tradeable products between different platforms."
			},
			{
				"title": "How do other developers can join The Sandbox platform?",
				"description": "Our Box's will support Scripts and Developers will only have to focus on creating original and fun experiences and publishing them on our platform, they will also have the possibility to generate cryptocurrency earnings for them"
			},
			{
				"title": "When will the game be launching?",
				"description": "We are currently hard at work developing some cool features like a user-generated content non-fungible token marketplace for creators, and the VOX editor in which to import or even make new creations from scratch. We are also researching the possibility to add several more features, like the possibility to share a social experience with your friends inside a BOX in real time, and building upon that feature, for creators to be able to add their own gameplay mechanics and systems through scripting tools."
			},
			{
				"title": "Why can't Minecraft or Roblox do what we are doing?",
				"description": "Both Minecraft & Roblox have platform versions where blockchain is not supported and would require a re-engineering of their entire monetization model. The Sandbox integrates Blockchain from the ground up into natural evolution for creators and players"
